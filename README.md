# spider with selenium and python

* you need selenium, python3

* you can use any webdriver you like(eg: Chrome, Firefox), I just use webdriver in selenium.

* target: https://www.tianyancha.com/

* this spider doesn't use proxy, maybe there is still some problems

* test.py is the main progrem

* testfei.py is used to get the company name or number which will be used in test.py

* just run it in pycharm
